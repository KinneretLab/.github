# KinneretLab

The repositories here include the codes used in publications from the lab of Prof. Kinneret Keren (Technion), primarily for image analysis in the context of Hydra regeneration. 

**The repositories include:**

DisplayFunctions - Creating binary masks and image adjustment using CLAHE.

LayerSeparationFull - Separating signal from basal and apical surfaces in 3D stacks and creating 2D projection images from these signals.

EPySegAdapter - Our application of EPySeg, a package for segmenting cells in 2D epithelia: https://github.com/baigouy/EPySeg.

OrientationAnalysis - Extracting orientation field and further analysis of nematic fibre orientation. Includes code adapted from Vahid K. Alilou (2024). FingerPrint Matching: A simple approach (https://github.com/alilou63/fingerprint).

PostSegmentationAnalysis - Quantification of cell-based measures from cell segmented images and tools for analysis in relation to fibre organisation.

MATLABUtilityFunctions - Supporting utility functions for all repositories.
